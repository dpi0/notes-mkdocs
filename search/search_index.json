HABITS","text":"<p>\u201cSuccess is the product of daily habits\u2014not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTime magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to predict where you\u2019ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBreakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.\u201d</p> <p>If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed what James calls, \u201cPlateau of Latent Potential.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It\u2019s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGetting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHabits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmall changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do not rise to the level of your goals.

Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve.

Technically, \u201cpower\u201d refers to the rate of flow of electricity, measured in watts. In this book, for the sake of readability, I\u2019ll use the term in its more general sense, as a synonym for \u201celectricity.\u201d 2 These calculations are drawn from a life cycle assessment of dams. Life cycle assessment is an interesting field that involves documenting all the greenhouse gases that a given product is responsible for, from the time it\u2019s produced until the end of its life. These assessments are a useful way to analyze the climate impact of various technologies, but they\u2019re pretty complicated, so in this book I will focus on direct emissions, which are easier to explain and generally lead to the same conclusions anyway. 3 Think of transmission as the freeway and distribution as the local road. We use high-voltage transmission lines to deliver electricity from the power plant to the city. Then the electricity goes into the local, lower-voltage distribution system\u2014the power lines you see in your neighborhood. 4 There\u2019s also seasonal variation for wind. In the United States, wind power tends to be at its peak in the spring and reach its low point in mid- to late summer (although it\u2019s the opposite in California). The difference can be a multiple of two to four. 5 Here\u2019s how I got these figures: Between August 6 and August 8, 2019, Tokyo consumed 3,122 gigawatt-hours of electricity. For baseload power, I assumed 5.4 million iron-flow batteries with a system lifetime of 20 years and a per-unit cost of $36,000. For peak demand, I assumed 9.1 million lithium-ion batteries with a system lifetime of 10 years and a per-unit cost of $23,300. 6 This model is available online for the public.

<p>https://trash-guides.info/File-and-Folder-Structure/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/</p> <p>[Short answer] Having a file in multiple locations without using double your storage space.</p> <p>[Long answer] Hardlinks are a way for a copy operation to be instant and not consume space for those additional copies.</p> <p>Every file is a hardlink: some metadata that points at blocks on the file system, which is why they're restricted to the same file system. There can be as many metadata files pointing at those blocks as needed and the blocks know how many links point to them. Once the blocks have 0 links, they're considered deleted.</p> <p>This means:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You can delete any \"copy\" without impacting other instances (hardlinks) of it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your download client can remove its \"copy\" without impacting the library \"copy\". The library \"copy\" can also be removed by Plex, Sonarr/Radarr, or manually without impacting your download client's \"copy\".</p> </li> <li> <p>Space is only reclaimed once all \"copies\" of data that are hardlinked are deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modifying any copy of a hardlinked file will impact all \"copies\".</p> </li> <li> <p>For example, modifying the id3 tags of a .mp3 download after import would modify the download client \"copy\", resulting in breaking the torrent.</p> </li> </ul> <p>\"hard link\" is just another term for a directory entry. Every name in a filesystem is a \"hard link.\"</p> <p>Soft link: When you delete or change attributes on /path/to/softlink-&gt;/path/to/realfile it only affects that softlink file.</p> <p>Hard link: When you delete or change attributes on /path/to/hardlink-&gt;/path/to/realfile, it affects both the hardlink and realfile.</p> <p>Think of a softlink as a \"shortcut\" in Windows. Think of a hardlink as the very same file existing in two paths on the disk.</p> <p>In the case of a file with multiple \"hard links\", there is no \"real file\". Every link is equally real.</p> <pre><code>/path/to/link2 -&gt; inode:5893\n/path/to/link1 -&gt; inode:5893\n</code></pre> <pre><code>echo \"Hello, World\" &gt; original_file.txt\n\nln

And if your task is severely broken, to where it's never exiting, you can end up with hundreds or thousands of stuck processes. Systemd addresses this as the service unit that it manages can only run one at a time.</p> <p>Another minor advantage might also be cleanly &amp; easily disabling/enabling the job. No having to go into a file and comment it out. Can also just stop the timer, ensuring that a reboot will start it back up.</p> <p>SystemD Timers are its equivalent of Cron Jobs.

The difference is that this directive is included in the ancillary unit allowing the primary unit listed to remain relatively clean. When a unit with this directive is enabled, a directory will be created within /etc/systemd/system named after the specified unit with .wants appended to the end. Within this, a symbolic link to the current unit will be created, creating the dependency. For instance, if the current unit has WantedBy=multi-user.target, a directory called multi-user.target.wants will be created within /etc/systemd/system (if not already available) and a symbolic link to the current unit will be placed within. Disabling this unit removes the link and removes the dependency relationship.</p> </li> <li> <p>RequiredBy=: This directive is very similar to the WantedBy= directive, but instead specifies a required dependency that will cause the activation to fail if not met.

Different platforms and editors display tabs with varying sizes. Since they are configurable, there is no guarantee that the code you\u2019ve written will be read the same way.</p> <p>Across all editors and platforms - a whitespace is always a whitespace. While tabs can be configured, the whitespace is the same no matter where it is shown.

Spaces advocates would prefer to specify them explicitly - consistency is most important.</p> <p>The debate between tabs and spaces for indentation in code is a long-standing one, with strong opinions on both sides. Here are the main points for each:</p> <p>This is a long-running debate that's been around almost as long as programming. There are arguments on both sides, but the main ones in favour of spaces are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You have to pick one. Regardless of the merits of either approach, both camps generally agree that mixing them is generally a disaster, so regardless of which is chosen, it's best to pick one, even if it's done by a coinflip. In python, that consensus is spaces, so it's best to stick with it even if you prefer tabs. Of course, the same would apply to tabs if that was chosen, but regardless, I think this is the most important reason: consistency with all other code is a bigger win than anything else.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot consistently align nested expressions with just tabs if you care about line-level indenting (eg lining up function parameters). This means you either need to avoid doing this, or mix tabs and spaces (ie tab to indent, then spaces to align). Both those approaches have their adherents, but spaces allows you to align as you like here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spaces tend to be more robust than tabs when going through stuff like copy &amp; pasting to email / web forums etc. (They're still often mangled, but generally anywhere spaces get mangled, tabs do too, but there are more situations where tabs are and spaces aren't)</p> </li> <li> <p>Everyone sees the code in the same way. This gets argued both ways, and is more a matter of preference - some prefer that you view other's code through your own preferred style, while others prefer it gets viewed as you see it (so, say, things like line length make sense with your indentation).</p> </li> </ul> <p>After a long development career, part of which has been opinionated on this issue.</p> <p>I have now come to the old and wise conclusion that it doesn't matter (the cynic in me, says that nothing really does).</p> <p>But for the love of Freyja, please be consistent about your choice.</p> <p>Apart from that</p> <p>Tabs, when you want the reader to be in control the layout</p> <p>Spaces, when you want the author be in control the layout.</p> <p>And in python, and other places where whitespaces has semantic meaning, just go with spaces.
