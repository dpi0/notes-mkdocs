<p><em>1 Fifty-one billion tons is based on the latest available data. Global emissions dropped a bit in 2020—probably by around 5 percent because the COVID-19 pandemic slowed the economy so dramatically. But because we don’t know the exact figure for 2020, I will use 51 billion tons as the total. We’ll return to the subject of COVID-19 periodically throughout this book.</em> 2 Hydropower—electricity created by water pouring through a dam—is another renewable source, in fact the biggest source of renewable energy in the United States. But we’ve already tapped most of the available hydropower. There’s not a lot of room to grow there. Most of the additional clean energy we want will have to come from another source</p>

<p>Most climate change reports use the Celsius scale for reporting temperature changes. I’ll follow that practice in this book, because that’s what you’ll see in most news reports. To get an idea of a temperature change in Fahrenheit that is accurate enough for most purposes, you can just double the Celsius number and remember that your estimate is a little high. Since most Americans think more naturally in Fahrenheit, I’ll use that scale when I’m referring to daily temperatures. *2 Here’s the math. Recent models suggest that the cost of climate change in 2030 will likely be between 0.85 percent and 1.5 percent of America’s GDP per year. Meanwhile, current estimates for the cost of COVID-19 to the United States this year range between 7 percent and 10 percent of GDP. If we assume that a similar disruption happens once every 10 years, that’s an average annual cost of 0.7 percent to 1 percent of GDP—roughly equivalent to the projected damage from climate change.</p>

<p>In preindustrial times—before the mid-18th century or so—the earth’s carbon cycle was probably roughly in balance, plants and other things absorbed about as much carbon dioxide as was emitted. But then we started burning fossil fuels adding extra gases. “getting to zero” doesn’t actually mean “zero.” It means “near net zero.” bigger the reduction, the bigger the benefit, so a 50 percent drop in emissions wouldn’t stop the rise in temperature; it would only slow things down at some point we’ll not only need to stop adding more gases but actually need to start removing some of the gases</p>

<p>In climate terms, a change of just a few degrees is a big deal. IPCC reports some uncertainty about how much and how quickly the temperature will go up and exactly what effect these higher temperatures will have. One problem is that computer models are far from perfect as climate is way too complex to be modeled accurately rn. We don’t know precisely what will happen but it will be bad for sure.</p>
<h4 id="storms">Storms<a class="headerlink" href="#storms" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>climate change is making storms wetter and increasing the number of intense ones. Scientists are still debating whether storms are happening more often because of the heat, but they appear to be getting more powerful in general.</p>
<h4 id="soil-moisture">Soil Moisture<a class="headerlink" href="#soil-moisture" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>By the 2100, soils in the southwestern United States will have 10 percent to 20 percent less moisture, and the risk of drought there will go up by at least 20 percent.</p>
<h4 id="wildfires">Wildfires<a class="headerlink" href="#wildfires" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>More frequent and destructive wildfires. Warm air absorbs moisture from plants and soil, leaving everything more prone to burning.</p>
<h4 id="sea-levels">Sea Levels<a class="headerlink" href="#sea-levels" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>sea levels will go up. This is partly because polar ice is melting, and partly because seawater expands when it gets warmer. most likely, a few feet by 2100</p>
<h4 id="plants-and-animals-being-affected">Plants and Animals being affected<a class="headerlink" href="#plants-and-animals-being-affected" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>According to research cited by the IPCC, a rise of 2 degrees Celsius would cut the geographic range of vertebrates by 8 percent, plants by 16 percent, and insects by 18 percent. mosquitoes will start living in new places (they like it humid, and they’ll move from areas that dry out to ones that become more humid)</p>
<h4 id="our-food">Our Food<a class="headerlink" href="#our-food" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>yields could go up, but in most places they’ll drop, by anywhere from a few percentage points to as much as 50 percent. sub-Saharan Africa, farmers could see the growing season shrink by 20 percent cut southern Europe’s production of wheat and corn in half by mid-century food prices could rise by 20 percent or more Extreme droughts in China—whose agricultural system provides wheat, rice, and corn Extra heat won’t be good for the animals we eat and get milk from; it will make them less productive and more prone to dying young fish and other sea life are moving to different waters, or simply dying off.</p>

<p>we use carbon dioxide equivalents CO2e to account for the fact that some gases trap more heat than carbon dioxide but don’t stay around as long. methane is much worse than co2, 120 times more warming, but doesn’t stay around as long as co2</p>

<p>Sunlight passes right through most greenhouse gases without getting absorbed. Most of it reaches the earth and warms up the planet reflects and some of this energy is emitted in just the right range of wavelengths to get absorbed by greenhouse gases. co2 and methane are, have the right structure to absorb this.</p>

<p>by mid-century, climate change could be just as deadly as COVID-19, and by 2100 it could be five times as deadly economic damage caused by climate change will likely be as bad as having a COVID-sized pandemic every 10 years large sections of the earth’s permanently frozen ground (called permafrost) gets warm enough to melt and releases the huge amounts of greenhouse gases, mostly methane, that are trapped there</p>
<ol>
<li>Adaptation minimize the impact of the changes that are already here and that we know are coming (later in chapter 9)</li>
<li>Mitigation stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, rich countries should go first and give solutions to developing world</li>

<p><em>1 These percentages represent global greenhouse gas emissions. When you’re categorizing emissions from various sources, one of the questions you have to decide is how to count products that cause emissions both when you make them and when you use them. For example, we produce greenhouse gases when we refine oil into gasoline and again when we burn the gasoline. In this book, I’ve included all the emissions from making things in “How we make things” and all the emissions from using them in their respective categories. So oil refining goes under “How we make things,” and burning gasoline is included in “How we get around.” The same goes for things like cars, planes, and ships. The steel that they’re made of is counted under “How we make things,” and the emissions from the fuels they burn go under “How we get around.”</em> 2 I consulted with many people about the Green Premium, including experts at the Rhodium Group, Evolved Energy Research, and climate researcher Dr. Ken Caldeira.

<p><em>1 I’m using the word “power” a bit loosely here. Technically, “power” refers to the rate of flow of electricity, measured in watts. In this book, for the sake of readability, I’ll use the term in its more general sense, as a synonym for “electricity.”</em> 2 These calculations are drawn from a life cycle assessment of dams. Life cycle assessment is an interesting field that involves documenting all the greenhouse gases that a given product is responsible for, from the time it’s produced until the end of its life. These assessments are a useful way to analyze the climate impact of various technologies, but they’re pretty complicated, so in this book I will focus on direct emissions, which are easier to explain and generally lead to the same conclusions anyway. <em>3 Think of transmission as the freeway and distribution as the local road. We use high-voltage transmission lines to deliver electricity from the power plant to the city. Then the electricity goes into the local, lower-voltage distribution system—the power lines you see in your neighborhood.</em> 4 There’s also seasonal variation for wind. In the United States, wind power tends to be at its peak in the spring and reach its low point in mid- to late summer (although it’s the opposite in California). The difference can be a multiple of two to four. <em>5 Here’s how I got these figures: Between August 6 and August 8, 2019, Tokyo consumed 3,122 gigawatt-hours of electricity. For baseload power, I assumed 5.4 million iron-flow batteries with a system lifetime of 20 years and a per-unit cost of $36,000. For peak demand, I assumed 9.1 million lithium-ion batteries with a system lifetime of 10 years and a per-unit cost of $23,300.</em> 6 This model is available online for the public.

<p>4000y old, it’s both strong and easy to shape when it’s hot to make steel, you need pure iron and carbon; on its own, iron isn’t very strong, but add just the right amount of carbon—less than 1 percent, depending on the kind of steel you want—and the carbon atoms nestle themselves in between the iron atoms, giving steel Carbon and iron aren’t hard to find—you can get carbon from coal, and iron is a common element in the earth’s crust. But pure iron is quite rare: when we dig up the metal, always combined with oxygen and other elements—a mixture known as iron ore. To make steel, you need to separate the oxygen from the iron and add a tiny bit of carbon. You can accomplish both at the same time by melting iron ore at very high temperatures (1,700 degrees Celsius in the presence of oxygen and a type of coal called coke. the iron ore releases its oxygen, and the coke releases its carbon. A bit of the carbon bonds with the iron rest is co2 1 ton of steel produces about 1.8 tons of carbon dioxide. it’s cheap iron ore and coal are cheap to extract by 2050 the world 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide from steel</p>

<p>We emit greenhouse gases (1) when we use fossil fuels to generate the electricity that factories need to run their operations (2) when we use them to generate heat needed for different manufacturing processes, like melting iron ore to make steel (3) when we actually make these materials, like the way cement manufacturing inevitably creates carbon dioxide</p>

The electricity causes the iron oxide to break apart, leaving you with the pure iron you need for steel, and pure oxygen as a by-product. No co2 is produced at all not proven yet on industrial scale</p>
<p>plastics could one day become a carbon sink—a way to remove carbon rather than emit it. First, we would need a zero-carbon way to power the refining process with clean electricity or with hydrogen produced from it to remove carbon dioxide from the air and extract the carbon, though that’s an expensive process. Another approach that various companies are working on is to get carbon from plants. finally we need a zero-carbon source of heat—which would likely also be clean electricity, hydrogen, or natural gas fitted with a device to capture the carbon it emits. we could make plastics with net-negative emissions and put it into a bottle or other plastic product, where it would stay for decades or centuries,</p>
<p>finally recycling more of our steel, cement, and plastic won’t be nearly enough to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, but it will help. buildings and roads can also be designed with the goal of limiting the use of cement and steel,</p>

If you’re watching your spending, you will feel the crunch of higher gas prices more than a rise in the cost of, say, olive oil, which you can always decide not to buy. But the point remains that among the things we consume on a regular basis, gasoline is relatively inexpensive.</em> 2 As a reminder, I’m counting only emissions from the fuel that various vehicles burn. The emissions from manufacturing them—making the steel and plastic, running the factories, and so on—are counted under “How we make things” and covered in chapter 5. *3 Air speed is usually measured in knots, but most people (including me) don’t know how much a knot is.

<p>*Electricity accounts for 99 percent of the energy used for space cooling around the world. Most of the other 1 percent is accounted for by natural-gas-fueled chillers for air-conditioning. Natural-gas-fired air-conditioning systems are available for single-family homes, but it’s such a small percentage of the market that the Energy Information Administration doesn’t even collect data on it.</p>
<p>We’ve now covered all five major sources of greenhouse gas emissions: how we plug in, make things, grow things, get around, and keep cool and warm. I hope three things are clear by now: (1) The problem is extremely complex, touching on almost every human activity. (2) We have some tools at hand that we should be deploying now to reduce emissions. (3) But we don’t have all the tools we need. We need to drive down the Green Premiums in every sector, which means we’ve got a lot of inventing to do.</p>

<p>both account for third of all emissions that come from the world’s buildings as runs on fossil fuels not elec like AC just like cars here, (1) electrify what we can, getting rid of natural gas water heaters and furnaces (2) develop clean fuels to do everything else.</p>

<p>as gases and liquids change temperature as they expand and contract. The pumps work by moving some coolant through a closed loop of pipes, using a compressor and special valves to change the pressure along the way so that the coolant absorbs heat from one place and gets rid of it somewhere else. like in fridges removes heat from inside of fridge so it stays cool and expels it outwards SIMPLE! still in only 11% US homes as furnaces are changed in 10 years &amp; not enough cash in hand but still pumps are cheaper to reduce elec load US policies favored furnaces over pumps despite of the fact that pumps save homes money so change in policies is needed half of all furnaces in US run on gas; worldwide, fossil fuels provide six times more energy for heating than elec does replacing FF with alt fuels are expensive and have high GP though at least 100% increase rn</p>
<p>So, (1) Electrify as much as we can, getting rid of gas-powered furnaces and water heaters and replacing them with electric heat pumps. In some regions, governments will have to update their policies to allow—and encourage—these upgrades. (2) Decarbonize the power grid by deploying today’s clean sources where they make sense and investing in breakthroughs for generating, storing, and transmitting power. (3) Use energy more efficiently. This may seem like a contradiction, because just a few paragraphs ago I complained about policies that prize higher efficiency over lower emissions. The truth is, we need both.</p>

A global network of research partners and advisers supports the commission. It’s co-managed by the Global Center on Adaptation and the World Resources Institute. *3 If you want to know the math: Sunlight is absorbed by the earth at a rate of about 240 watts per square meter. There’s enough carbon in the atmosphere now to absorb heat at an average rate of about 2 watts per square meter. So we need to make the sun dimmer by 2/240, or 0.83 percent. However, because clouds would adjust to solar geoengineering, we would actually need to dim the sun a bit more, to about 1 percent of the incoming sunlight. If the amount of carbon in the atmosphere doubles, it would absorb heat at a rate of about 4 watts per square meter, and we would need to double the dimming to about 2 percent.</p>

<p>For many poor farmers, earning more money is a chance to invest in high-value assets, including chickens, goats, and cows—animals that provide good sources of protein and a way to bring in extra cash by selling milk and eggs. It’s a sensible decision. But that’s the conundrum: As people rise up the income ladder, they do more things that cause emissions. need innovations—so the poor can improve their lives without making climate change even worse. the world’s poor are doing essentially nothing to cause climate change, typical Kenyan produces 55 times less carbon dioxide than an American later droughts and floods will become more frequent, wiping out harvests more often. Livestock eat less and produce less meat and milk. The air and soil lose moisture, leaving less water available for plants; in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, tens of millions of acres of farmland will become substantially drier. Crop-eating pests are already infesting more acreage as they find more hospitable environments to live in. The growing season will also get shorter; at 4 degrees Celsius of warming, most of sub-Saharan Africa could see it shrink by 20 percent or more. this makes food far more expensive for those who can least afford it &amp; agriculture in these areas not feasible today child born in Chad is 50 times more likely to die before her fifth birthday than a child born in Finland number of additional heat-related deaths could approach 10 million a year by 2100 those who don’t die will be far more likely to suffer from stunting—that is, to not fully develop physically or mentally raise the rates of malnutrition and death in these poor countries vaccine program GAVI prevented 13 million deaths since 2000, ranks as one of humanity’s greatest achievements many investors say we need to make our aid budget climate-sensitive not fund vaccines But Africa is responsible for only about 2 percent of all global emissions.

<p>minimize the impact of the changes that are already here and that we know are coming related to agriculture 3 ways so that farmers in the poor nations could adapt are, (1) Help farmers manage the risks from more chaotic weather govt should give social-security systems and arranging for weather-based agriculture insurance help farmers grow a wider variety of crops and livestock so one setback doesn’t wipe them out. (2) Focus on the most vulnerable people i.e Women no land rights, no equal access to water, or get financing to buy fertilizer, or even be able to get a weather forecast promoting women’s property rights and targeting technical advice specifically for them if given, 20-30% more food on their farms &amp; reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12-17% (3) Factor climate change into policy decisions little of $500 billion that governments spent on agriculture between 2014 and 2016 was directed at activities that works on climate change new policies and incentives to help farmers reduce their emissions while growing more food at the same time. inshort, Rich are causing the vast majority of climate change. The poorest people are doing less than anyone else to cause the problem, but they stand to suffer the most from it. They deserve the world’s help, and they need more of it than they’re getting.</p>
<p>3 stages of adaptation (1) reduce the risks from climate change climate-proofing buildings and other infrastructure, protecting wetlands as a bulwark against flooding encouraging people to relocate permanently from areas that are no longer livable. (2) responding to emergencies improve weather forecasts and early-warning systems for getting out information about storms. during disasters, need well-equipped and well-trained teams of first responders and a system in place for handling temporary evacuations. (3) after a disaster, there’s the recovery period We’ll need to plan for services for people who’ve been displaced—services like health care and education—as well as insurance that helps people at all income levels rebuild and standards to ensure that whatever gets rebuilt is more climate-proof than what was there before.</p>

The Green Premiums give countries, and especially middle- and low-income countries, a major incentive to resist cutting their emissions. There are markets worth billions of dollars waiting for someone to invent low-cost, zero-carbon cement or steel, or a net-zero liquid fuel. Making these breakthroughs and getting them to scale will be hard, but the opportunities are so big that it’s worth getting out in front of the rest of the world. Someone will invent these technologies. It’s just a question of who and how soon.</p>

<p>Hans Rosling said, “When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems—and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better.” by using a fact-based worldview, We can see what stands in the way of deploying the solutions we have and developing the breakthroughs we need we can see all the work we must do to overcome those hurdles.</p>
<p>I’m an optimist because I know what technology can accomplish and because I know what people can accomplish. I’m profoundly inspired by all the passion I see, especially among young people, for solving this problem. If we keep our eye on the big goal—getting to zero—and we make serious plans to achieve that goal, we can avoid a disaster. We can keep the climate bearable for everyone, help hundreds of millions of poor people make the most of their lives, and preserve the planet for generations to come.</p>

<p>The phrase “we have to work together” If rich countries worry only about lowering their own emissions and don’t work to make clean technologies practical for everyone, we’ll never get to zero</p>

<p>climate science tells us why we need to change course but not how to do it. For that, we must draw on engineering, physics, environmental science, economics, and more.</p>

<p>in 2020, vaccination rates dropped to levels last seen in the 1990s. We lost 25 years of progress in about 25 weeks. Rich nations more they invest in strengthening health systems around the world, the more prepared we will be for the next pandemic In the same way, we need to plan for a just transition to a zero-emissions future rich ones will need to acknowledge that the energy transition will be disruptive for the communities that rely on today’s energy systems significant portion of the working class economy will be affected, and there should be a transition plan in place for those communities</p>

<p>By investing in clean-energy research and development—R&amp;D—governments can promote economic recovery that also helps reduce emissions govt can help clean-energy companies grow by adopting policies that reduce the Green Premiums and make it easier for green products to compete with their fossil-based competitors</p>

<p>year 2020 was a huge and tragic setback The support for action on climate change is just as high as it was in 2019. Our emissions, it seems, are no longer a problem that we’re willing to kick down the road.</p>
<p>The question now is this: What should we do with this momentum? To me, the answer is clear. We should spend the next decade focusing on the technologies, policies, and market structures that will put us on the path to eliminating greenhouse gases by 2050. It’s hard to think of a better response to a miserable 2020 than spending the next ten years dedicating ourselves to this ambitious goal.</p>
